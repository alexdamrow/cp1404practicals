# Line 1

# This line prints a random number between 5 and 20. The smallest number that
# could have been printed was 5 and the largest was 20 due to the use of the
# randint function.


# Line 2

# Line 2 produced only odd numbers between 3 and 10, this meant it was
# impossible to get a 4 as it is even. The largest number that could have been
# printed was 9  and the smallest was 3.


# Line 3

# Line 3 printed a number between 2.5 and 5.5, including decimals.
# The largest number that could have been printed was 5.5 and the smallest is
# 2.5
