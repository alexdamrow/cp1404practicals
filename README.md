# CP1404 Practicals

This is the repository for [my](https://github.com/alexdamrow) CP1404 practicals. This will include all code and
programs for each prac, following what was instructed in
the [CP1404 practical instructions](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals/tree/master).\
Here is a handy guide
for [programming patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#data-storage).

## Things I have learned

- Using meaningful names when naming, so that it is obvious what a variable or constant is
- Change repeating code into separate functions e.g. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Include doc strings or comments where code may be confusing
