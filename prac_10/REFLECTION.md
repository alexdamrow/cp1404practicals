# Estimates
My accuracy for the estimates was ok, but it didn't really improve over the practicals.
Probably because parts of the question took less/more time than expected.

# Code Reviews
I really found doing the code reviews helpful, as it made me understand my own code better and where i could improve.
Being reviewed also helped, as it was a review from another perspective that wasn't my own or Lindsay's.

Here are two code reviews I did:
- [code review 1](https://github.com/rickyfrancis48/cp1404practical/pull/4)
- [code review 2](https://github.com/Ronjn/cp1404practicals/pull/3)
# Practical Tasks
One thing I would change about the pracs would be to include more on-paper work. 
We only did it twice over the 10 pracs, so I definitely think it could have been done more, maybe as a warmup activity.
